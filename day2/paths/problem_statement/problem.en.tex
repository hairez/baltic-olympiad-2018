\problemname{Paths}
We have a graph which consists of $N$ vertices and $M$ edges, and each vertex has one of $K$ colors.
The task is to find the number of paths in the graph, such that no two vertices in the path have the same color.

A path is defined as an ordered list of nodes of size at least $2$, such that
there are edges between consecutive nodes in the list.

Observe that the list is ordered, so e.g. ``\texttt{1-2-3}'', ``\texttt{1-3-2}'' and ``\texttt{3-2-1}'' are all treated as different paths.

\section*{\inputsection}
The first line of input contains three integers $N$, $M$ and $K$ ($1 \le N, M \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le K \le 5$).

The second line of input contains $N$ integers between $1$ and $K$ -- the color of each vertex.

The following $M$ lines each contain two integers $a, b$ ($1 \le a, b \le N, a \neq b$) -- the numbers of vertices connected by an edge.

There will be at most one edge between any two vertices.

\section*{\outputsection}
Print one integer -- the number of paths whose vertices all have distinct colors.

\section*{\sampleexplanation{1}}
There are 10 paths whose vertices all have distinct colors: ``\texttt{1-2}'', ``\texttt{2-1}'', ``\texttt{2-3}'', ``\texttt{3-2}'', ``\texttt{2-4}'', ``\texttt{4-2}'', ``\texttt{1-2-4}'', ``\texttt{4-2-1}'', ``\texttt{3-2-4}'' and ``\texttt{4-2-3}''.

Note that ``\texttt{1}'' is not allowed as a path, because it has length $1$, nor is ``\texttt{1-2-3}'', because it contains two nodes of color $1$.
