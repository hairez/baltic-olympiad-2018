For villains that intend to take over the world, a common way to avoid getting caught
is to clone themselves. You have managed to catch an evil villain and her $N-1$ clones, and you are now
trying to figure out which one of them is the real villain.

To your aid you have each person's DNA sequence, simplified to consist of
$M$ digits, each being either one or zero. You also know that the clones are not perfectly made;
rather, their sequences differ in exactly $K$ places compared to the real
villain's. 

Can you find the real villain?

\section*{\inputsection}
The first line contains the three integers $N, M, K$, where $1 \le K \le M$.

Then follows $N$ lines, representing the DNA sequences. 
Each of these lines consists of $M$ characters, all either \texttt{0} or \texttt{1}.

There is exactly one sequence that differs from all the other sequences on exactly $K$ places. 

\section*{\outputsection}
Output an integer -- the index of the DNA sequence that belongs to the villain.
The sequences are numbered starting from $1$.
