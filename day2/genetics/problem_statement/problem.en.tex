For villains that intend to take over the world, a common way to avoid getting caught
is to clone themselves. You have managed to catch an evil villain and her $N-1$ clones,
and you are now trying to figure out which one of them is the real villain.

To your aid you have each person's DNA sequence, simplified to consist of
$M$ digits, each being either zero or one. You also know that the clones are not perfectly made;
rather, their sequences differ in exactly $K$ places compared to the real villain's.

Can you identify the real villain?

\section*{\inputsection}
The first line contains the three integers $N$, $M$, and $K$, where $1 \le K \le M$.
The following $N$ lines represent the DNA sequences.
Each of these lines consists of $M$ characters, each being either \texttt{0} or \texttt{1}.

There is exactly one sequence that differs from all the other sequences in exactly $K$ places.

\section*{\outputsection}
Output an integer -- the index of the DNA sequence that belongs to the villain.
The sequences are numbered starting from $1$.
