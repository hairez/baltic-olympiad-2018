# Testdata Tools

`gen.sh` contains bash helper functions for working with problems for the
Kattis format, particularly ones that use multiple test groups.
See `generator_example.dsl.bash` for example usage.

This directory is intended to be copied into your contest's top-level directory
and committed. `gen.sh` may be changed freely if needed.
